# IOMemory-VSL

This is an unsupported update of the original driver source for FusionIO
cards. It comes with no warranty, it may cause DATA LOSS or CORRUPTION.
Therefore it is NOT meant for production use, just for testing purposes.

## Background
Driver support for FusionIO cards has been lagging behind kernel
releases, effectively making the cards an expensive paperweight
when running a distribution like Ubuntu which supplies newer kernels.
Deemed a trivial task to update the drivers and actually make them work
with said newer kernels, and putting the expensive paperweight to use again
so I could access my data..., set forking and fixing the code in motion quite
a while ago.

## Important note!!!
Only the version branches are tested, nothing else. The driver may
in fact work with older or newer kernels but none have been tested. The
latest reliable tested versions are from 3.19 and upwards. Testing and
running with the kernel module has solely been done on Ubuntu.

## Building
Module building can be done according to the original README.

## Installation
Installation can be done according to the original README.

## DKMS
A dkms.conf file is supplied, so it should be plug and play:
```
sudo cp -r iomemory-vsl/root/usr/src/iomemory-vsl-3.2.14 /usr/src/
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/dkms/iomemory-vsl/3.2.14/build
sudo ln -s /usr/src/iomemory-vsl-3.2.14 /var/lib/dkms/iomemory-vsl/3.2.14/source
sudo dkms build -m iomemory-vsl -v 3.2.14
sudo dkms install -m iomemory-vsl -v 3.2.14
sudo modprobe iomemory-vsl
```
With fio-utils installed you should see the following:
```

## Other notes
Installing the fio-util, fio-common, fio-preinstall and fio-sysvinit are
recommended.
When moving from source 2.3.11 to source 3.2.14 the firmware HAS TO BE UPDATED
to 3.2.10.20150212.
